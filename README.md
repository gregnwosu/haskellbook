# Why
Embarassingly enough one of the primary reasons I had for learning Haskell was the usenet post
"...and then theres Haskell" . I wondered if Haskell could really be that....different. 

# How
I first decided to learn haskell around December 2013 its now December 2016 and I think I've finally grasped it. 
To Haskell's credit this wasnt due to Haskell being difficult to learn; it was more to do with the lack of decent educational material.
...Until now

# haskellbook
