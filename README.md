# Why
Embarassingly enough one of the primary reasons I had for learning Haskell was the usenet post "...and then theres Haskell" which I 
have included in full below. I wondered if Haskell could really be that....different. I now confess, its all true ;-)

# How
I first decided to learn haskell around December 2013 its now December 2016 and I think I've finally grasped it. 
To Haskell's credit this wasnt due to Haskell being difficult to learn; it was more to do with the lack of decent educational material.
...Until now

# haskellbook
despite the controversy (see the racsim incident at lambdaconf 2015) , its still a great book and deserves attention, heres mine
